Features in order of priority:

- being able to configure how sensitive is hte automatic recovery process
  by setting a time value in seconds

- #12 : Reuse PVC (see below) and Primary becomes a Replica

    As part of the available options for the field "failover.pvc", there would be:
        - "retain": the default option currently with Kubegres where PVC are kept but not reused for safety and investigation reasons
        - "delete": the PVC will be deleted
        - "reuse": if the state of the PVC is healthy, it will be reused by the newly created Replica pod. I think that matches with your suggestion?

- #20 : Delete PVC (is it the same as #12?)

- add a test in spec_readinessProbe_test and spec_livenessProbe_test so that
  we test the default behaviour when no option is set from the YAML

- #30: Add one or many sidecar container options in Kubegres YAML

- #51: add documentation about how to recover backup
- add use cases documentation, for example how to expand storage manually and how to upgrade Postgres major version.
- check how to setup log archiving in case of replica does not found a data

- #46: Define Service Type for Primary and Replica

- #7  : Allow major version upgrade using pg_upgrade

- #35 : Restore database from a PV backup

- #82 : Allow using a unique image for the backup job

- #10 : Deploy Kubegres with a HELM chart

- #?: PG bouncer

- #? : Add a field to allow restarting StatefulSets and Pods via the YAML of "Kind: Kubegres"?

Blocked:
#49 : Expand Storage (waiting on the Kubernetes feature: https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/2842)
